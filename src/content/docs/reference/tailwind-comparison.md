title: "Tailwind Migration Context"
description: "Synced Flow documentation for Tailwind Migration Context."
---
Tailwind CSS is referenced here only to help teams migrate existing projects.
Synced Flow is an independent fluid CSS system, not a Tailwind copy,
compatibility layer, or one-for-one feature replacement.

## Developer Expectations During Migration

Teams coming from Tailwind often expect a short install flow, a CLI, generated
CSS from source files, clear framework setup, safelisting for dynamic class
names, and setup diagnostics. Synced Flow supports those expectations while
using its own fluid, token-led styling model.

| Migration expectation | Synced Flow direction |
| --- | --- |
| Install a package, import one stylesheet, start building | `pnpm add @syncedco/flow`, `synced-flow init`, import the generated CSS entry |
| CLI builds CSS from scanned source files | `synced-flow build` scans configured project folders and writes generated utility CSS |
| Framework-specific setup docs | `synced-flow init --preset next/vite/astro/plain` |
| Theme variables as the styling API | CSS custom properties in `@syncedco/flow/styles.css` plus project overrides |
| Source registration and monorepo-friendly paths | `scan` and `cwd` config options |
| Safelisting for dynamic class names | `safelist` config option and `--safelist` CLI flag |
| Setup diagnostics | `synced-flow doctor` |

## How Synced Flow Differs

Synced Flow starts with a fluid design system rather than a breakpoint-first
utility framework. New projects keep `responsiveVariants` off, then use fluid
type, spacing, layout primitives, and container-aware component CSS.

For CSS size, Synced Flow favours modular layer imports and source-scanned
utility generation rather than shipping a large universal utility file. See
[CSS optimisation](css-optimisation.md) for current size measurements and
marketing-safe claims.

Responsive variants such as `sm:` and `lg:` are available only as an explicit
migration option:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  scan: ['app', 'components', 'lib'],
  out: 'app/synced-flow.generated.css',
  responsiveVariants: true,
})
```

## Migration Docs Should Keep

- `init` should get a project compiling quickly.
- `build --check` should fail CI when generated CSS is stale.
- `doctor` should explain missing imports, config, scripts, and stale setup.
- Docs should show copy-pasteable install paths for common frameworks.
- Scanner docs must clearly explain dynamic class limits.
- Token docs should show the primitive, semantic, and component layers.
