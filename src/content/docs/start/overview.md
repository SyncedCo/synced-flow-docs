AI-friendly fluid CSS design system for brand-consistent websites, agency builds,
and modern frontend projects.

Synced Flow gives developers and AI coding agents a shared styling contract:
fluid tokens, layout primitives, accessible components, website recipes, and
source-scanned utility CSS.

Use it when you want AI-assisted build speed without breakpoint soup, one-off
brand drift, or generated class chaos.

The current package release is `@syncedco/flow@0.3.1`. This release includes
the audit hardening for mobile drawer scrolling, vertically centered tabs,
dark-mode action/status tokens, filter-bar alignment, status-chip dot opt-outs,
reduced-motion safeguards, public z-index tokens, and AI-friendly positioning.

- fluid by default: Utopia-style type and spacing with modern `clamp()` scales
- token-led: primitive, semantic, and component tokens using CSS custom
  properties and OKLCH colour
- agent-readable: `catalog --json`, `suggest`, `recipe`, `pattern`, `lint`,
  `doctor`, and project-local AI guidance
- agency-ready: presets for WordPress, Next, Astro, Vite, and plain HTML
- accessible defaults: visible focus states, skip links, reduced-motion
  safeguards, and state styling
- lean CSS loading: modular layers plus generated utilities scanned from real
  project usage
- layout primitives: container, section, stack, cluster, grid, sidebar,
  switcher, frame, cover, hero, and flow
- component primitives: buttons, cards, surfaces, navigation, forms, alerts,
  badges, avatars, charts, and section headers
- website patterns: logo clouds, feature blocks, stats, testimonials, pricing,
  FAQ, CTA, and footer helpers
- native component styling: dialog, popover, drawer, tooltip, disclosure, tabs,
  breadcrumbs, pagination, scroll snap, and sticky patterns
- AI-friendly CLI discovery: `catalog --json`, `suggest`, `lint`, `watch`, and
  `theme init --from` for turning a site brief into reusable theme tokens
- project-level AI agent setup: `agents install`, `agents status`, and `skill`
  make the packaged Synced Flow skill visible to common coding agents
- accessibility and base helpers: `sr-only`, `not-sr-only`, skip links, focus
  rings, touch targets, link helpers, and list helpers
- accessibility state styling for invalid, required, disabled, busy, current,
  expanded, pressed, selected, target, and forced-colors states
- modular CSS layer exports when a project wants a smaller imported surface
- modern CSS best practices: cascade layers, custom properties, logical
  properties, `clamp()`, OKLCH colour, container-aware primitives, and
  reduced-motion safeguards

## Open Source

Synced Flow core is released under the [MIT licence](LICENSE). The open-source
core includes the CSS library, CLI, WordPress preset, modern frontend examples,
documentation, and recipes.

The MIT licence covers the software. It does not grant rights to use Synced,
SyncedCo, or Synced Flow branding in a way that implies official endorsement.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @syncedco/flow
pnpm exec synced-flow init --preset next --theme synced --agents
```

`--agents` adds project-level AI guidance so Cursor, Codex-style agents, Claude,
Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini, and Aider can discover the Synced Flow skill and
recommended CLI checks from the consuming project.

Until the package is published to a registry, install it from the GitHub repo:

```bash
pnpm add git+https://github.com/SyncedCo/synced-flow.git
```

## Import

Most projects should choose one core import strategy.

Use the full stylesheet when simplicity matters:

```css
@import "@syncedco/flow/styles.css";
@import "@syncedco/flow/defaults.css";
```

`styles.css` already includes the tokens, reset, base, layout, components, and
static utilities layers. Do not also import those modular layer files alongside
`styles.css`.

`defaults.css` is optional. It applies common site/UI defaults such as removing raw
link underlines and list markers. Leave it out for content-heavy pages that
should keep browser affordances by default.

For tighter CSS loading, skip `styles.css` and import only the layers the
project uses:

```css
@import "@syncedco/flow/tokens.css";
@import "@syncedco/flow/reset.css";
@import "@syncedco/flow/base.css";
@import "@syncedco/flow/defaults.css";
@import "@syncedco/flow/layout.css";
@import "@syncedco/flow/components.css";
@import "@syncedco/flow/utilities.css";
```

## CSS Size And Loading

Synced Flow is designed to avoid shipping a large universal utility stylesheet.
It uses modern CSS techniques and keeps CSS loading compact in three ways:

- the CLI scans source files and generates utility CSS only for discovered class
  tokens
- CSS layers are exported separately, so projects can import only tokens, reset,
  base, site/UI defaults, layout, components, or static utilities as needed
- generated animation keyframes are emitted only when scanned animation classes
  need them

The core CSS is built around current browser capabilities rather than legacy
breakpoint-heavy patterns: fluid `clamp()` scales, CSS custom properties,
logical sizing and spacing, cascade layers, OKLCH colour tokens,
container-aware layout primitives, and `prefers-reduced-motion` handling.

Current built CSS sizes for `@syncedco/flow@0.3.1` on 2026-06-13:

| File | Raw | Gzip | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `styles.css` | 84.1 KB | 14.1 KB | Full core stylesheet for simple setup. |
| `tokens.css` | 11.8 KB | 2.5 KB | Design tokens only. |
| `reset.css` | 0.7 KB | 0.4 KB | Reset layer only. |
| `base.css` | 3.4 KB | 1.2 KB | Base element styles. |
| `defaults.css` | 0.5 KB | 0.3 KB | Optional site/UI defaults for links, lists, and native controls. |
| `layout.css` | 12.2 KB | 2.8 KB | Fluid layout, app shell, scroll, sticky, media, and split primitives. |
| `components.css` | 49.2 KB | 7.7 KB | Button, icon, avatar, chart, card, surface, nav, form, alert, native component, app primitive, website pattern, accessibility state, and input primitives. |
| `utilities.css` | 7.5 KB | 1.9 KB | Static `sf-*` content, positioning, motion, and helper utilities. |

CSS is not automatically tree-shaken like JavaScript in every environment. The
Synced Flow approach is explicit and predictable: import the core layers you
need, then run `synced-flow build` so project utilities are generated from real
usage.

For WordPress themes and plugins, `synced-flow init --preset wordpress` scans
PHP/template files and writes one enqueue-ready CSS file at
`assets/css/synced-flow.css`.

See [CSS optimisation](docs/css-optimisation.md) for the full measurements,
developer notes, and marketing-safe claims.

## Base Styling Decisions

Synced Flow keeps the browser affordances people rely on:

- links stay visibly underlined by default
- `ul` and `ol` keep their markers by default
- focus states are visible through `:focus-visible`
- reduced-motion preferences are respected

Use opt-in helpers when UI needs a different treatment: `sf-link-plain` for
navigation links, `sf-list-reset` for menu lists, `sr-only` for assistive text,
`sf-skip-link` for skip navigation, and `sf-touch-target` for compact controls.
For site/UI projects, include `@syncedco/flow/defaults.css` or run
`synced-flow add defaults` to apply those common UI defaults globally.

See [Base styling decisions](docs/base-styling.md).

## Icons

Synced Flow supports icons without shipping an icon set. Use `sf-icon` on
inline SVGs or external libraries such as Lucide, Heroicons, or Bootstrap Icons;
icons inherit `currentColor` and size from fluid system tokens.

```tsx
import { Settings } from "lucide-react"

<button className="sf-button">
  <Settings className="sf-icon" aria-hidden="true" />
  Settings
</button>
```

## Configure

`synced-flow init` creates `synced-flow.config.mjs`, a CSS entry file, a
generated CSS placeholder, and `flow:build` / `flow:check` / `flow:lint` /
`flow:watch` package scripts.

To add AI agent guidance to an existing project:

```bash
pnpm exec synced-flow agents install
pnpm exec synced-flow agents status
pnpm exec synced-flow skill
```

Use `--target all` to also add tool-specific project files for Cursor, Claude,
Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini, and Aider where those tools support project-local
instructions or skills.

Start by shaping the theme: radius style, font family, primary colour, accent
colour, surface treatment, and density. With AI, ask it to use the Synced Flow
skill and convert that brief into `synced-flow.config.mjs` theme tokens before
building pages.

You can also create the config by hand:

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@syncedco/flow/config'
import { themePresets } from '@syncedco/flow/presets'

export default defineConfig({
  scan: ['app', 'components', 'lib'],
  out: 'app/synced-flow.generated.css',
  responsiveVariants: false,
  theme: themePresets.synced,
  safelist: ['hidden', 'flex'],
})
```

Import the generated file after the core stylesheet:

```ts
import '@syncedco/flow/styles.css'
import './synced-flow.generated.css'
```

Add package scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "flow:build": "synced-flow build",
    "flow:check": "synced-flow build --check",
    "flow:lint": "synced-flow lint",
    "flow:watch": "synced-flow watch",
    "flow:doctor": "synced-flow doctor"
  }
}
```

Run setup checks:

```bash
pnpm flow:doctor
```

Discover the supported starter surface:

```bash
pnpm exec synced-flow tokens
pnpm exec synced-flow tokens --json
pnpm exec synced-flow catalog --json
pnpm exec synced-flow suggest "full page scroll portfolio"
pnpm exec synced-flow recipe portfolio-scroll --markup
pnpm exec synced-flow recipe portfolio-scroll --framework next --markup
pnpm exec synced-flow theme init --from brief.md
pnpm exec synced-flow theme init --from brief.md --preset-base neutral-saas
```

## Use

```html
<section class="sf-section">
  <div class="sf-container sf-stack" style="--sf-stack-space: var(--sf-space-l)">
    <span class="sf-badge">Fluid by default</span>
    <h1 class="sf-text-display">A styling system that adapts without layout breakpoints.</h1>
    <p class="sf-text-lead sf-prose">Use shared tokens and layout primitives before project-specific styling.</p>
    <a class="sf-button" href="/contact">Start a project</a>
  </div>
</section>
```

The CLI also accepts flags for projects that do not want a config file:

```bash
synced-flow build --scan app --scan components --out app/synced-flow.generated.css
```

Use `--include-core` only when you want the generated CSS file to contain the
reset, base, layout, and component layers instead of importing
`@syncedco/flow/styles.css` separately.

For WordPress themes or plugins, use the WordPress preset. It scans PHP and
template files and writes one CSS file that can be enqueued directly:

```bash
pnpm exec synced-flow init --preset wordpress
pnpm flow:build
```

New projects should keep `responsiveVariants` off. Turn it on only when migrating
an existing codebase that still contains compatibility classes such as `sm:` or
`lg:`.
